								    *nvim-cdbg
This plugin makes it easier to begin debugging a C/C++ project using cmake.
It is meant to be used for large projects with multiple sub-directories.
Not ideal for simple projects that are contained in a single directory (It is
recommended to use ':make' for simple projects.)


							      *nvim-cdbg.setup
nvim-cdbg.setup( {options} )

	Setup the plugin to use certain commands and build paths.


							*nvim-cdbg.start_debug
nvim-cdbg.start_debug()

	Runs ':packadd termdebug' and ':Termdebug'.
	Opening the GDB and program execution, alongside the source code, in
	neovim.


							  *nvim-cdbg.compile()
nvim-cdbg.compile()

	Compiles the project using the given build command.
	The default is 'cmake --build <build-path>'.
	It utilizes git to find the root directory.
	It does three checks, before compiling:
		1. Check if the project is a git repository, to find the root
		directory of the project.
		2. Check if the root directory contains a 'CMakeLists.txt'
		3. Check if the specified build path exists.
		4. Run the compile command, starting on the root directory and
		outputting in the specified build path.
